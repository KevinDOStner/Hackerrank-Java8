# Hackerrank-Java8
Trying to solve questions with Java 8 lingo.

Some where the decision to use Java-8 has not be made because of time considerations.
The whole idea is to practice more of Java-8 lingo and get familiar with newer concepts in Java-8.

If you're using these codes, please don't blindly copy them in hackerrank. 
I am providing the input of these snippets using the file resource (`input.txt`).

## Setting up

#### Local

  - Clone this repo
  - Import it as a Java project in IDE
  - Copy the sample input in hackerrank question to `input.txt`

#### Hackerrank

  - Copy the code to hackerrank editor.
  - Remove the package name.
  
     ```java 
    package {xyz};
    ```
  - Change the class name to `Solution`
  
    ```java
    public class Solution
    ```
  - Change the input mechanism to Hackerrank complaint.
  
    ```java
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    ```
    
    
> ###### Disclaimer : I am a Java-8 noob and I am trying to come up with best solutions in Java-8. These solutions might not be the best solutions algorithmatically and / or in terms of Java-8 complaint. I am open to all kinds of suggestions/criticism/discussions regarding these solutions. If you have better and effective Java-8 solutions for these problems please put it forward. It'll be a learning experience for me too.
